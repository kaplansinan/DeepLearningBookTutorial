## DeepLearningBookTutorial

This repositoyr contains summary of chapters listed below from [Deep Leaarning Book](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/):

1. Probability
2. Optimization
3. Regularization
4. Convolutional Neural Networks
5. Sequential Modeling
6. Representation Learning

In additon to the book, I have also composed data augmentation techniques in the notebook called ***DATA_AUGMENTATION_STRATEGIES***. 

### Running Noteebooks

To go through notebooks online, please go [mybinder.org](https://gke.mybinder.org/) and copy-paste the url of this repository to section ***GitHub repository name or URL***. 

Afterwards click on **launch** button and  wait for a time until it compiles the repo and generates a link to click and start running the noteboks.
