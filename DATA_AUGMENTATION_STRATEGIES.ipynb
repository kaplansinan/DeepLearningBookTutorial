    "Data augmentation is mostly used as regularizer and to make model more robust noise and different inputs. In other words, performing data augmentation for deep learning models is known to be important for training visual recognition systems. By artificially increasing the number of training examples, it helps reducing overfitting and improves generalization.\n",
